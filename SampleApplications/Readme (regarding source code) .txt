The source code is contained in two folders: Folder VS2002 and Folder VS2003.

Folder VS2002 has Visual Basic .NET and COBOL .NET code samples grouped by chapters that were developed using Microsoft’s Visual Studio .NET version 1.0
and Fujitsu’s NetCOBOL for .NET version 1.1, respectively.

Folder VS2003 has the same Visual Basic .NET samples as in folder VS2002, except that the samples were converted to run under Microsoft’s Visual Studio .NET version 1.1 (also known as Microsoft’s Visual Studio 2003).

You will notice that Folder VS2003 does not contain any COBOL .NET code samples. At the time of this writing, Fujitsu’s current version (1.1) of NetCOBOL for .NET is fully compatible and integrates with Microsoft’s Visual Studio .NET version 1.0, but not Microsoft’s Visual Studio .NET version 1.1. Be sure to check the Net-COBOL Web site (www.netcobol.com) for the latest news of a compatible NetCOBOL for .NET release from Fujitsu.
